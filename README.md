# Cloudline slot machine

This is the test I had to complete in part of my job application for junior React developer in Cloudline. Cloudline is a startup, that is providing software for virtual quoting and order and pay.

## Installation

```npm
cd cloudline-slot-machine
```

```npm
npm install
```

## Usage

```npm
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Vision

The task was to use style-components. I never worked with this library before, and I wasn't satisfied at all. Anyway, I used the styled-components library, but if that wasn't the task I rather use preprocessor with CSS, because it will provide better-structured code.

My plan was to build an automated reusable component, which style and complexity can be change via props.

Here is a preview of the application:
